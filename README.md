## 🐱 TheCatAPI Integration

This project uses [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) to fetch adorable cat images for the cards.

To use the API:

1. Get a free API key from [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/signup)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_CAT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
````

**Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

## Rarity and Statistics system

To draw a random rarity and statistics use `game/stats.ts` module with `drawRarity` and `drawStatistics` respectively.Generated using weighted algorithm with `Math.random()` method.

### Usage

```ts
drawRarity() -> Rarity
```

```ts
drawRarity(rarity: Rarity) -> Stats
```

### Rarity chart with Statistics
